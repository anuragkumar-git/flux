# 🟢 [Flux](https://anuragkumar-git.github.io/flux/) — Offline First Time Tracking PWA

A modern, offline-first productivity timer built with React + Vite.
Designed for focused study and deep work sessions with clean architecture and scalable foundations.

## ✨ Features (v1.0.0)

- ⏱ Session-based time tracking

- ⏸ Pause & auto-terminate after 10 min inactivity

<!-- - ⏳ Configurable session limit (default 3 hours) -->

- 📅 Day-wise grouped history

- ✏️ Inline session title editing

- 📊 Daily total time calculation

- 📱 Mobile-first responsive UI

- 🌿 Modern emerald productivity theme

- ⚡ Offline support (PWA)

- 💾 IndexedDB persistence using Dexie

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

Flux follows a layered architecture:
```
UI (React Components)
        ↓
Hook Layer (useSession)
        ↓
Service Layer
        ↓
Session Engine (Domain Logic)
        ↓
Repository Layer (IndexedDB via Dexie)
```
#### Why this matters:

- UI is fully separated from domain logic

- Persistence layer can be swapped with backend later

- Engine is pure and testable

- Scalable for multi-device sync in future versions

## 🧠 Session Rules

- A session can be:

    - Running

    - Paused

    - Ended

- If pause exceeds 10 minutes → session auto-ends

- If a session crosses midnight → it ends exactly at the day boundary

- Paused time is NOT counted in total duration

- Session descriptions are editable

- System controls duration logic

## 🛠 Tech Stack
